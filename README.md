# Tetris

## Introduction: A Journey in Code

What started as a quest to sharpen my Python skills quickly became something much more exciting. I had brainstormed countless project ideas, but none of them truly matched my abilities or ignited my passionâ€”until inspiration struck. Tetris.

The idea hit me like a falling tetromino, and I realized immediately it was the perfect fit. Simple at its core, yet challenging enough to push my skills, it embodied everything I was looking for. Not only is it a timeless and addictively fun game, but it's also the ideal starting point for diving into Pygame, a project that wouldn't rely on step-by-step tutorials.
